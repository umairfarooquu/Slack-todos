# 🚀 GitHub Setup Commands

## After creating your GitHub repository, run these commands:

### 1. Add GitHub as remote origin

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
```

### 2. Push your code to GitHub

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Verify the push worked

```bash
git remote -v
```

## 📋 Complete Steps:

1. **Create GitHub Repository**:

   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Repository name: `slack-todo-bot`
   - Description: `🤖 Smart Slack bot for task management with natural language processing`
   - Choose Public/Private
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README (we have one)
   - Click "Create repository"

2. **Copy the HTTPS URL** from the new repository page

3. **Replace YOUR_USERNAME and YOUR_REPO_NAME** in the commands above

4. **Run the commands** in this directory

## 🎯 Example (replace with your actual GitHub username):

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/nafeesulhussain/slack-todo-bot.git
git push -u origin main
```

## ✅ What will be published:

- ✅ Complete bot source code
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation (README, SETUP, EXAMPLES)
- ✅ Package.json with all dependencies
- ✅ Environment template (.env.example)
- ❌ NO sensitive credentials (.env is ignored)

## 🔒 Security Notes:

- Your actual `.env` file with credentials is NOT included
- Only `.env.example` template is published
- Users will need to add their own Slack credentials

## 🚀 After Publishing:

Your repository will be ready for others to:

1. Clone the repository
2. Follow SETUP.md instructions
3. Add their own Slack app credentials
4. Deploy their own todo bot instance
